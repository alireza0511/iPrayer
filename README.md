## App Description

This app built for Halghe Mysticism users to help them to their practices. They can add their own Ertebat (a type of meditation in Halghe Mysticism) list. Because the user should practice together, each practice that creates by user share to the community. Once the practice is displayed in a table view, the user can select a practice to open a detail view of that practice. In the detail view. 

Furthermore, users can write a comment about each practice.

## Build Instructions

CocoaPods is an iOS dependency manager or in everyday speak, a tool for incorporating code already written by others so that you donâ€™t have to write everything from scratch. at this project I use:

```bash
pod 'Firebase/Storage'
pod 'Firebase/Core'
pod 'Firebase/Database'
pod 'Firebase/RemoteConfig'
pod 'FirebaseUI'
```
To access the CocoaPods please instal Pod, Install the pods and open the .xcworkspace file to see the project in Xcode.
```bash
$ pod install
$ open The-project.xcworkspace
```
please don't forget to Download the ```GoogleService-Info.plist``` file.
